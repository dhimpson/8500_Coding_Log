## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was attempting to make my first commits to github from VS Code when I encountered failure messages.

**What went wrong:**
I ran into an issue with my first attempt to commit. VS Code could not identify my github account. After trouble-shooting and googling the issue, I had to reintroduce my github account to VS code by identifying my user name and email.  After doing this, I was able to push commits with no problem. After rectifying the user/id issue, I also had a issue with merging my work inorder to commit. This was easier to fix. I am not sure why the user/id issue happended in the first place.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt - I attempted to commit multiple times in VS Code, thinking that somehow my unfamiliarity with the interface was the issue.
2. Second attempt - I googled the error message to try to understand what I could do to reconnect my github account to the VS Code App
3. [Additional attempts- what helped most was scrolling through the git code in the VS Code terminal and following the prompts there. This actually helped the most.

**Resources I consulted:**
- [x ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [describe] Just precisely worded google searches to try to identify the problem and how to fix it.

**Resolution:**
Ultimately, reading back through the git failure data in my terminal helped the most. It told me how to reconnect my github account to the VS Code interface.

**What I learned:**
I learned to not be afraid to look back through the terminal for specific errors and advice. This may sound silly, but the terminial is rather intimidating at first glance. I also have a hard time visually disciphering information within it. I think it visually overloads my brain. Perhaps, overtime, I will get more used to it.
