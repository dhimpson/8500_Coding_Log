## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to Create a list of presidents and store it in a variable. Use an `if` statement to check if the number of presidents in the list is more than 5. 

**What went wrong:**
I could not get my list of presidents to be accepted as a variable. Originally this is what I had: list_of_presidents <- ("Carter", "Regan","HWBush","Clinton", "WBush","Obama")

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I removed all the "" thinking that maybe I put them in the list by accident.
2. I reinserted the "" and removed the , between items
3. I reinserted both and then googled my code. I then realized that I had forgot to add the 'c' in front of the () to tell r what to do with the list (concatenate). 

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ x] Other: Google

**Resolution:**
My list then looked like this: list_of_presidents <- c("Carter", "Regan","HWBush","Clinton", "WBush","Obama") However,later,I could not get my 'if' statemet to work. I realized that I had forgot to add the length() function to my list in my 'if' statement to tell the program to see the list as a number of items.

**What I learned:**
This reminded me to be careful to make sure that I have all of the correct pieces of my code in before I run it. Also the issue with length made me stop and question if I had given the program all of the necessary information it needs to perform the function that I have asked it to do.

### Challenge 2: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
Find the first 5 locations of New York City in the gayguides data (use next, break, and create a counter).

**What went wrong:**
Cannot seem to get past this problem.(line number 192- question concerning NYC in gayguides) Here is the beginning code that I have:
for (i in 1:length(gayguides$city)) {
  (if [i] != New York City)
  next
  (if [i] = New York City)
  print([i], 5)
  break
}
```

**My problem-solving process:**
1. [First attempt - what you did and what happened]
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]

- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours

### Challenge 3 (Optional): Finding voter's occupations in the Boston Women Voters data.

**What I was trying to do:** 
I was trying to write a function that accepts the name of an occupation. Ultimately, I needed my function to return new dataframe that includes the records for every voter listed with that occupation. This was very tricky. Here is my final product. 

bwv.occupations <- function(job_title) { 
  data(BostonWomenVoters)
  result <- data.frame()
  for (i in 1:nrow(BostonWomenVoters)) {
    if (BostonWomenVoters$Occupation[i] == job_title)
  {
    result <- rbind(result, BostonWomenVoters[i, ])

  }
   
  return (result)
}}

**What went wrong:**
First, I had my data frame inside of my function, which caused issues. Then I could not seem to get my entire function to print out a result.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt - googled each piece of the question: ie. reviewed how to create a function. Tried to make sure that my function was loaded into my enviroment, but it would not load no matter what I did. I googled this and finally realized that R was not activated. I am not sure why, but I had times this week where R would deactivate repeatedly as I was working. Once I reactivated it, my function loaded appropriately.
2. After getting past the hurdle with R, I still could not get a dataframe to show me the voting records by occupation. I checked my captialization and spaces. I could not find where the mistake was.
3. I copied the code and placed it in Slack. Dr. R pointed out that I was missing a set of brackets, which proved to be the trick.

**Resources I consulted:**
- [x ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ x] Course materials: scrolled up the WS for previous examples, also course notes
- [ X] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ X] Other: Google search

**Resolution:**
Adding brackets resolved this. I am still a little confused about when and where to place curly brackets.

**What I learned:**
I learned to be thorough in my code and to track down the beginning and ending brackets.
