## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to Create a list of presidents and store it in a variable. Use an `if` statement to check if the number of presidents in the list is more than 5. 

**What went wrong:**
I could not get my list of presidents to be accepted as a variable. Originally this is what I had: list_of_presidents <- ("Carter", "Regan","HWBush","Clinton", "WBush","Obama")

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I removed all the "" thinking that maybe I put them in the list by accident.
2. I reinserted the "" and removed the , between items
3. I reinserted both and then googled my code. I then realized that I had forgot to add the 'c' in front of the () to tell r what to do with the list (concatenate). 

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ x] Other: Google

**Resolution:**
My list then looked like this: list_of_presidents <- c("Carter", "Regan","HWBush","Clinton", "WBush","Obama") However,later,I could not get my 'if' statemet to work. I realized that I had forgot to add the length() function to my list in my 'if' statement to tell the program to see the list as a number of items.

**What I learned:**
This reminded me to be careful to make sure that I have all of the correct pieces of my code in before I run it. Also the issue with length made me stop and question if I had given the program all of the necessary information it needs to perform the function that I have asked it to do.

### Challenge 2: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
Find the first 5 locations of New York City in the gayguides data (use next, break, and create a counter).

**What went wrong:**
Cannot seem to get past this problem.(line number 192- question concerning NYC in gayguides) Here is the beginning code that I have:
for (i in 1:length(gayguides$city)) {
  (if [i] != New York City)
  next
  (if [i] = New York City)
  print([i], 5)
  break
}
```

**My problem-solving process:**
1. [First attempt - what you did and what happened]
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]

**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]
