## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
This problem: Can you find all locations in 1975 except for New York and San Francisco? Here is my code:

locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city - "New York" & city - "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year = 1975)

**What went wrong:**
Could not get code to run. I have two errors: one says that the "editor selection is not within an executable cell". I copied it and pasted into the cell below this problem and then ran the code. Then, I received the following error message:
> locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city - "New York" & city - "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year = 1975)
+ filter(Year = 1975)
Error in `filter()`:
ℹ In argument: `city - "New York" & city - "San
  Francisco"`.
Caused by error in `city - "New York"`:
! non-numeric argument to binary operator
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt- I am unsure of how to tell R to not include New York and San Francisco. I think that is where my error is. I am going to remove the minuses and try something else.
2. Second attempt - I removed the minuses and added back the  equal sign that I had from a previous attempt. I am adding a ! in front of the = to see if that works. I also added == for year. My corrected code looks like this:
locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city != "New York" & city != "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year == 1975)


3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ x] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ x] Course materials: [which ones] notes from Monday's class
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ x] Other: Quick google search of the problem.

**Resolution:**
Using the ! sign in addition to the = provided what I needed to exclude these two cities. 

**What I learned:**
 I tried -= to exclude the two cities. Then I tried !==. Neither of these worked. From my notes I noticed that we used - in class with select(), but that was when we were choosing to not include whole columns in the datasest (ie. city or state). The != allowed me to narrow it down to specific cities.
