## What I Worked On This Week

**Assignment(s):**
- [ ] Worksheet [#4]
- [ ] Other: I also began to work through R for Data Science again as more practice. I created a folder for the exercises that can be accessed via github. I began this after Wednesday's class where I struggled recalling how to do basic things. More practice (and rereading the text) seems to be helping as I work through the remainder of this week's worksheet. I am not needing to google as much to figure out how to get my code to work.

## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
This problem: Can you find all locations in 1975 except for New York and San Francisco? Here is my code:

locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city - "New York" & city - "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year = 1975)

**What went wrong:**
Could not get code to run. I have two errors: one says that the "editor selection is not within an executable cell". I copied it and pasted into the cell below this problem and then ran the code. Then, I received the following error message:
> locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city - "New York" & city - "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year = 1975)
+ filter(Year = 1975)
Error in `filter()`:
ℹ In argument: `city - "New York" & city - "San
  Francisco"`.
Caused by error in `city - "New York"`:
! non-numeric argument to binary operator
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt- I am unsure of how to tell R to not include New York and San Francisco. I think that is where my error is. I am going to remove the minuses and try something else.
2. Second attempt - I removed the minuses and added back the  equal sign that I had from a previous attempt. I am adding a ! in front of the = to see if that works. I also added == for year. My corrected code looks like this:
locations_in_1975 <- gayguides %>% filter(city != "New York" & city != "San Francisco") %>%
filter(Year == 1975)


3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ x] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ x] Course materials: [which ones] notes from Monday's class
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ x] Other: Quick google search of the problem.

**Resolution:**
Using the ! sign in addition to the = provided what I needed to exclude these two cities. 

**What I learned:**
 I tried -= to exclude the two cities. Then I tried !==. Neither of these worked. From my notes I noticed that we used - in class with select(), but that was when we were choosing to not include whole columns in the datasest (ie. city or state). The != allowed me to narrow it down to specific cities.

### Challenge 2: = vs. == 

**What I was trying to do:**
I was attempting the worksheet problem on BostonWomenVoters where I needed to create a new column called `ward_missing` that is TRUE when Ward is NA and FALSE otherwise?

**What went wrong:**
I almost had the code right, but it just would not work. Here is what I had: 
BostonWomenVoters %>% 
  mutate(ward_missing == is.na(Ward))

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt - I first double checked my notes regarding mutate() and creating a new column and using is.na to get a TRUE/FALSE response of the presence of NA in rows. It looked like my code should have worked.
2. Second attempt - I did not check the == to see if it was the problem. I ended up coping my code and putting it in google. It looks like the == was creating an issue. The == was making R look for a column called 'ward_missing' which did not exist. I needed to use a single = to give the command for a new column called 'ward missing' to be created and to then fill it with the results of is.na(ward). Switching to = seemed to fix the problem.
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ x] Course materials: [which ones] class notes and notes from R for Data Science
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ x] Other: Google search as noted above

**Resolution:**
Ultimately, this worked, but I still get confused about when to use == and when to use =. What I read said to use = when attempting to define arguments or new column names inside functions like mutate() select() or filter().

**What I learned:**
I learned how to create a new column and move rows with missing data into it. I think this could be helpful when working with a dataset that may be fragmentary and missing information.
