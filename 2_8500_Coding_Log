## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: Getting to the final step (solving) of the Challenge 1 problem

**What I was trying to do:**
After completing steps 1 to 4 of challenge 1, I realized that I still had not solved the initial problem of finding all of the locations in California in the 1970s. 

**What went wrong:**
I could not recall how to see inside of my variable to see the info that I had created a subset for.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I revisited my notes and decided to use the typeof() function to try to identify the data in my dataset. My data is logical. Logical data only lists TRUE and FALSE. I need locations... this is a problem.
2. I began to reevaluate my process. For reference, here is what I originally had:
  ```{r}
gayguides$state=="CA"
```
```{r}
is_1970s <- gayguides$date >= "1970-01-01" & gayguides$date <= "1979-12-31"
```
```{r}
CA_70s <- is_1970s & gayguides$state=="CA"
typeof(CA_70s)
(CA_70s)
```
I googled everything step by step. Right away, i noticed that I did not create a logical vector in step 1.
I redid step one and created a logical vector. ca_locations <- gayguides$state=="CA". I kept my work on step 2. Then I combined my conditions of ca_locations and is_1970s to the new variable of CA_70s
 I think I did this correctly and its just a logical vector at the end that does not display a "list" of locations, but I am not sure.
