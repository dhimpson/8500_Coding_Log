## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: Getting to the final step (solving) of the Challenge 1 problem

**What I was trying to do:**
After completing steps 1 to 4 of challenge 1, I realized that I still had not solved the initial problem of finding all of the locations in California in the 1970s. 

**What went wrong:**
I could not recall how to see inside of my variable to see the info that I had created a subset for.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I revisited my notes and decided to use the typeof() function to try to identify the data in my dataset. My data is logical. Logical data only lists TRUE and FALSE. I need locations... this is a problem.
2. I began to reevaluate my process. For reference, here is what I originally had:
  ```{r}
gayguides$state=="CA"
```
```{r}
is_1970s <- gayguides$date >= "1970-01-01" & gayguides$date <= "1979-12-31"
```
```{r}
CA_70s <- is_1970s & gayguides$state=="CA"
typeof(CA_70s)
(CA_70s)
```
I googled everything step by step. Right away, i noticed that I did not create a logical vector in step 1.
I redid step one and created a logical vector. ca_locations <- gayguides$state=="CA". I kept my work on step 2. Then I combined my conditions of ca_locations and is_1970s to the new variable of CA_70s
 I think I did this correctly and its just a logical vector at the end that does not display a "list" of locations, but I am not sure.
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ x] Course materials: class notes
- [ ] Slack discussion

**Resolution:**
how do i get a list of locations from a logical vector

**What I learned:**
I learned how to combine vectors using "&"

### Challenge 2: Finding Data about Boston Women Voters for extra practice

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to find out how many women in the dataset are listed as "housewife"

**What went wrong:**
Attempting to follow my previous example from the challenge 2 question but it returned void.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. First attempt - I decided to use str()to see the titles of variables within the dataset and make sure that I have not misspelled/mislabled something.
2. Second attempt - I followed the steps of what I did in Challenge 2 and used the sum() function to find the number of women who had housewives listed as their occupation (3167)
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [x ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [x ] Course materials: worksheet 2
- [ x] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
this code worked sum(BostonWomenVoters$Occupation == "Housewife")

**What I learned:**
I learned how to find the total number of entries of a subset of a dataset.

## Reflection

**What I understand well now:**
R is clicking more for me. It is still like a foreign land, but I think I am understanding the basics more and things are not quite as hard as they were two weeks ago. I do not feel quite as lost. I have a greater understanding of what to google and how to phrase my google prompts to get a better solution.

**What I'm still confused about:**
Challege 1 question is still bothering me. I think I was supposed to have an actual list of places to answer the question with, however since I ended up with a logical vector, I just got a list of TRUE and FALSE. I know that we went over this in class on Wednesday, but my notes are not really helping.

**Connection to historical research:**
The ability to subset my data on Little Texas and see what occupations were over time and by gender will be very useful. Current research on Greenville's Black communities says that the only middle class neighborhood with "professional" jobs was the Haynie-Sirrine neighborhood. I am interested in seeing if that is true and being able to subset my data by occupation will be most useful.
